### Hints

> [!hint]- Hint(s)
> 1.  This has something to do with signed and unsigned ints in C

### Step(s)
---
1. Once connected to the server you get the options:
   ```css
Welcome to the flag exchange
We sell flags

1. Check Account Balance

2. Buy Flags

3. Exit

 Enter a menu selection
```

2. This will let you know the following:
   Balance = 1100
   Defintely no the flag flag: cost 900
   1337 Flag: cost 100,000
3. Time to look into the Code! We can see that the variable `total_cost` on line 38 is a signed int which means that any number passed not within the range of -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 will result in an overflow error. and since on line 39 it will get assigned by doing 300 * number_flags (a variable that you input) you can force `total_cost` to overflow so when your account balance is assigned on line 42 you will actually be gaining money. (Be careful to not provide to big of a number so you don't end up overflowing to a positive number)
4. I went with 2500000 as the amount of knockoff flags to buy which results in a large balance

2500000

The final cost is: -2044967296

Your current balance after transaction: 2044968396

5. Now go buy the 1337 flag you rich bastard.
