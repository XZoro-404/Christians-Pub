### Description
---
I wrote you aÂ [song](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/c594d8d915de0129d92b4c41e25a2313/lyrics.txt). Put it in the picoCTF{} flag format.
### Hints
---

> [!hint]- Hint(s)
> 1. Do you think you can master rockstar?

### Step(s)
---
1. When first looking at the file it does not make much sense but seeing the repeating of "shout" and "put" and that the file does look like some sort of program. With these in mind if we take a look at the hint we can see that you can master "rockstar" so if we do a google search of [put shout rockstar](https://www.google.com/search?q=put+shout+rockstar&oq=put+shout+rockstar) which will show us that there is a programming language called rockstar.
2.  Using the [Rockstar editor](https://codewithrockstar.com/online) we can input the text of the file to get the output:
```undefined
114
114
114
111
99
107
110
114
110
48
49
49
51
114
```
3. Then using cyberchef we can decode this to get our flag or Since it looks close to decimal encoding we can use any decimal decoder
